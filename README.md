# SARS-Cov-2
This repo summarize the tools used in the analysis of SARS-Cov data. Some papers are also recommended here. 


## Data Sources
### 1, GISAID: Global Initiative on Sharing All Inflenza Data: https://www.gisaid.org/
The GISAID Initiative promotes the rapid sharing of data from all influenza viruses and the coronavirus causing COVID-19. 

### 2, COG-UK Mutation Explorer: http://sars2.cvr.gla.ac.uk/cog-uk/ 
This gives the SARS-Cov data in UK, including data update, features analysis(anigenic, drug resistance, et al), and very good visulization. 

### 3, CoV-GLUE: A Web Application for Tracking SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Variation: http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/ 
CoV-GLUE maintains a database of mutations, insertions and deletions which have been observed in GISAID hCoV-19 sequences sampled from ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 

## Tools -- focusing on github code based on publications
